The most basic way to vary the current through the load is through pulse width modulating (PWM) the enable pin.
Resistive loads are one of the simplest loads to drive as they follow Ohmâ€™s Law, it's simple because the designer knows the voltage and the resistance of the load. With these two parameters we can calculate the maximum current that will be flowing through the circuit. Knowing this information is the first step in selecting the correct device to drive this load.
Common inductive loads are relays, motors, and solenoids and when they are switched off inductive loads can generate a transient negative voltage due to the stored magnetic energy in the inductance. This transient voltage can cause severe damage to the drive circuit. To prevent any potential damage, during switch-off the stored magnetic energy must be dissipated by clamping the voltage across the inductive load. It is necessary to integrate a power clamp circuitry that protects the circuit by clamping the voltage over the switch to a set voltage and recirculating the current through the clamp. This causes the stored energy to be safely dissipated. With this large clamp voltage the demagnetization time is decreased leading to a safe and quick turn off time for inductive loads.
