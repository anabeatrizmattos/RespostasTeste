A multidrop system is a master and slave system. One master connects with a few slaves in the system. Each time, the master communicates with one of the slaves. When the master wants to transfer a block of data to a slave, it first sends out an address byte to identify the target slave. The 9th-bit of the data byte sent from the master is set to 1 to indicate the address byte while cleared to 0 to indicate the data byte. All the slave systems will compare the address byte with their own address. Only the target slave will respond to the master. The master then starts transmitting data bytes to the target slave. The non-addressed slave systems will ignore the incoming data until a new address byte is received.
Since UARTs are 8-bit devices, the parity bit is used as the 9th-bit. Thus, the master needs to set parity bit before it sends out data and the slave needs to check the parity bit to decide whether it is an address byte or a data byte.
